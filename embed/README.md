# ESM Backdrop — drop-in pack

Rotating full-screen backgrounds (the same 104 images as the ESM office screen:
NASA deep space, Earth from orbit, real landscapes, abstract light) with the
**ESM disc** on top. Two files, no dependencies, no build step. Made to be handed
to another project: mount it, put your own content on top, done.

```
esm-backdrop/
├── esm-backdrop.js      the module  (window.ESMBackdrop)
├── esm-backdrop.css     the styles  (everything prefixed .esmb)
├── demo.html            a working full-screen demo
├── fetch-slides.sh      optional: download the 104 images for local hosting
├── backgrounds.json     the image list (only in the full pack, points at slides/)
└── slides/              the images, 2560×1440 JPEG (only in the full pack, ~38 MB)
```

Full pack (with images): **https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/embed/esm-backdrop-pack.zip**
Live demo: **https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/embed/demo.html** (`?interval=0.2` to see it change fast)

## 1. Easiest and safest: one iframe (nothing to copy, nothing to update)

```html
<iframe src="https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/backdrop.html?follow=1"
        style="position:fixed;inset:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0;z-index:0"
        sandbox="allow-scripts" loading="eager"></iframe>
```

The images, the per-image motion, this code and the settings all stay on the ESM
site, so the screen is steered from `remote.html` and **never needs a file
copied or updated again**. The browser puts the iframe in its own origin:
nothing inside it can read your DOM, your variables, your cookies or your
storage, and `sandbox="allow-scripts"` also stops it navigating your page
(verified — the checks come back BLOCKED and the frame's origin is `null`).
Put your own content on top with a higher `z-index`.

Parameters: `follow=1` (mirror the house config — rotation, playlist, pin,
palette, movement), or drive it yourself with `interval=3`, `motion=gentle`,
`palette=teal`, `disc=0`, `discsize=60vmin`, `wordmark=Your|Brand`,
`categories=space,earth`, `start=52-space-andromeda`, `vignette=0`.

*Requires the host to send CORS headers (GitHub Pages does).* If you ever serve
this from somewhere that doesn't, drop `sandbox` or add `allow-same-origin`.

Trade-off: it needs the ESM site reachable. For a screen that must survive the
site being down, self-host instead (§3).

## 2. Hot-link the two files from the ESM site

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/embed/esm-backdrop.css">
<script src="https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/embed/esm-backdrop.js"></script>
<script>
  ESMBackdrop.mount({ intervalMinutes: 3 });   // fixed full-screen layer, disc on, new image every 3 min
</script>
```

The image list is fetched from the site (`assets/backgrounds.json`), the images
stream from there too. Your own content goes on top: anything with
`position: fixed/absolute` and `z-index` above 0.

## 3. Self-hosted (for a screen that must work when the ESM site is down)

Copy the two files into your project, then either unzip the full pack (it already
contains `backgrounds.json` + `slides/`) or run `sh fetch-slides.sh` next to them.
Then point `base` at that folder:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/esm-backdrop/esm-backdrop.css">
<script src="/esm-backdrop/esm-backdrop.js"></script>
<script>
  ESMBackdrop.mount({
    base: "/esm-backdrop/",            // where backgrounds.json + slides/ live
    manifest: "backgrounds.json",      // relative to base (the pack's manifest points at slides/…)
    intervalMinutes: 3,
  });
</script>
```

If the manifest cannot be loaded the module falls back to its built-in list of
the 104 file names (resolved against `base + "assets/slides/"`, the site layout).

## 4. Inside a box instead of full-screen

```html
<div id="stage" style="position:relative; width:100%; aspect-ratio:16/9;"></div>
<script>
  ESMBackdrop.mount({ el: "#stage", intervalMinutes: 3, discSize: "60vmin" });
</script>
```

The container needs `position: relative|absolute|fixed`; the backdrop fills it.
Note the disc is sized in **viewport** units by default (`78vmin`) because it is
meant for a TV; pass `discSize` (any CSS length) for a box.

## Paired mode: keep it in step with the ESM screen

```html
<script>ESMBackdrop.mount({ follow: true });</script>
```

`follow: true` makes this screen read the ESM house config
(`https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/config.json`, once a minute) and
mirror it: the rotation interval, the playlist, a pinned image, the palette and
the movement setting.
Both screens then compute the same slot from the clock and switch at the same
second, and the ESM remote (`remote.html`) steers both. Nothing is sent back.

For the two to match exactly they need the same image list (leave `manifest`
alone in follow mode so both read the site's list — or keep a full local copy
via `fetch-slides.sh`), the same interval (choose "Every 3 minutes" on the
remote; both screens follow), and the same time zone (slots are local time).
`follow: "some/other.json"` reads a different config; `followPalette: false`
keeps your own palette; `followEveryMs` changes the polling (min 15 s).

## Security notes (for the other project)

- **Use the iframe (§1), or self-host the two files (§3).** Both keep ESM code
  out of your page's origin: the iframe because the browser isolates it, the
  copy because it can't change under you. What to avoid is §2 — hot-linking the
  script into your page, which lets anyone who controls the ESM-Screen repo run
  code in your app.
- With the iframe, what crosses into *your page* is a picture, nothing else.
  With self-hosted code, the only things that cross from the ESM site are
  **data**: two JSON files (image list, config) and JPEGs. The module validates
  every field it uses (whitelisted keys, tokens `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, image paths
  that must end in `.jpg/.png/.webp` and stay on the `base` origin, palette from
  a fixed set) and never
  evaluates anything it fetched. Requests are sent without credentials.
- Worst case if the ESM site were ever hijacked: your screen shows the wrong
  pictures. No script, no cookies, no tokens, no inbound connection, nothing
  written anywhere. Drop `follow` and `base` (use the local copy) and even
  that goes away.
- The CSS pulls the *Fredoka* font from Google Fonts via `@import`; delete
  that line to have zero third-party requests.

## Options

| option | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `el` | *(creates a fixed full-screen layer)* | selector or element to fill |
| `base` | `https://easyscalemedia.github.io/ESM-Screen/` | root the manifest and image paths are resolved against |
| `manifest` | `assets/backgrounds.json` | image list (string or array of candidates, relative to `base` or absolute) |
| `slides` | — | explicit array of image URLs; skips the manifest |
| `intervalMinutes` | `3` | minutes per image (`0.5`, `3`, `60`, `1440`…) |
| `motion` | `"gentle"` | drift: `off` · `subtle` · `gentle` · `lively` (each image's own motion, scaled) |
| `motionManifest` | `assets/motion.json` | per-image motion, relative to `base` |
| `followMotion` | `true` | in follow mode, also take the movement setting |
| `follow` | — | `true` = mirror the ESM `config.json` (interval, playlist, pin, palette); or a URL/path to another config |
| `followPalette` | `true` | in follow mode, also take the palette |
| `followEveryMs` | `60000` | how often the followed config is re-read (min 15 s) |
| `categories` | *(all)* | e.g. `["space","earth","nature","abstract"]` — `art` is the flat illustrated set |
| `playlist` | — | explicit tokens (`"41-space-cosmic-cliffs"`) and/or category ids |
| `shuffle` | `true` | seeded shuffle per cycle (every image once per cycle); `false` = folder order |
| `start` | — | token to start pinned on (rotation stays off until `unpin()`) |
| `disc` | `true` | show the ESM disc |
| `palette` | `"orange"` | `orange`, `navy`, `electric`, `teal`, `purple` |
| `discSize` | `"78vmin"` | any CSS length; everything inside scales with it |
| `discFloat` | `true` | the gentle 14 s bob |
| `wordmark` | `"Easy Scale\|Media"` | two lines split on `\|` |
| `vignette` | `true` | soft dark edges so the disc reads on bright photos |
| `fadeMs` | `1600` | cross-fade duration |
| `zIndex` | — | z-index for the created layer |
| `onChange(info)` | — | called after every change: `{ src, index, total, token, cat, name }` |

`mount()` returns a controller: `next()`, `prev()` (both pin), `pin(token)`,
`unpin()`, `interval(minutes)`, `motion(id)`, `current()`, `palette(id)`, `slides`,
`destroy()`.

## The drift

Each image moves slowly in the way that suits it, decided from the picture
itself (`tools/make_motion.py` in the repo writes `motion.json`): a strong
horizon slides sideways, a bright subject in the middle is pushed into, an
all-over texture drifts diagonally. Amplitudes are ~1–3% of the frame over
1.5–2.5 minutes, at the same apparent speed for every image, easing at both ends
— alive, not a screensaver. `motion: "off"` freezes it, and
`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured automatically. Without `motion.json`
everything falls back to one gentle diagonal drift.

## How the rotation picks an image

Local time is cut into slots of `intervalMinutes`. Each slot maps to one image
through a seeded shuffle per cycle, so every image is shown exactly once before
the order reshuffles, and two screens with the same list and interval show the
same image at the same moment — no server, no sync, just the clock. The next
image is pre-decoded before the fade, and a TV that slept re-checks on wake.

## TV notes

- Plain ES5-style code (no optional chaining, no modules): runs on older Chromium
  TV browsers. Needs `fetch` and `Promise` (Chrome 42+).
- Images are 2560×1440 progressive JPEG, ~370 KB each; only two are decoded at a
  time. The image is held still on purpose — a slow Ken-Burns zoom was found
  nauseating on an 85" panel.
- The disc's wordmark uses the *Fredoka* web font (loaded by the CSS `@import`
  from Google Fonts); offline it falls back to the system sans.
- Want the rocket flight, particles, the light wave, clock or weather too? Take
  `styles.css`/`app.js` from the ESM-Screen repo — this pack is deliberately just
  backgrounds + disc.
